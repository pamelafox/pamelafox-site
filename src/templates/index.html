   <div class="divider">want to contact me?</div>
   <div class="inner">
    <p>Please know the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My time is limited since I have a nursing baby, a toddler, and a full-time job. Alas, I  will need to say "No" to most requests of my time that aren't related to my family or work.
      <li>In terms of conferences and meetups, I may be available for local events (bay area) or virtual events. I have more availability during the workday (when I have childcare) than evenings/weekends. I'm the most interested in events that relate to Python or Microsoft Azure, given my current job.
      <li>If you'd like to report a bug or a feature request with the Khan Academy coding platform,
      <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=261028">please use KA ZenDesk</a>.<br>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're still keen on sending me a message after reading that, go for it! My gmail address is exactly what you'd expect it to be ðŸ˜Š.</p>
