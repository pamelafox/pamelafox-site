    "description": "In our final session of the Python + AI series, we tackle a crucial topic: how to use AI safely, and how to evaluate the quality of AI outputs. There are multiple risk mitigation layers when working with LLMs: the model itself, a safety system on top, the prompting and context, and the application user experience. Our focus is on Azure tools that make it easier to put safe AI systems into production. We show how to configure the Azure AI Content Safety system when working with Azure AI models, and how to handle those errors in Python code. Then we use the Azure AI Evaluation SDK to evaluate the safety and quality of the output from our LLM. ",

Then we focus on the new structured outputs mode available in OpenAI models, which can be used with Pydantic models and even used in combination with function calling. Our examples demonstrate the many ways you can use structured responses, like entity extraction, classification, and agentic workflows. ",

    "description": "Know a bit of Python and want to start programming with language models, like OpenAI's GPT series? In this session, we'll talk about the world of LLMs, including SLMs (small language models), and show how we can use the OpenAI Python SDK to interact with many models. We'll do a bit of prompt engineering, play around with few-shot examples, and even implement basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). We'll also demonstrate how to use the streaming responses and asynchronous client. If you'd like to follow along, make sure you've got a GitHub account and access to either the Azure OpenAI API or the OpenAI.com API.",

    "description": "If you're trying to get an LLM to accurately answer questions about your own documents, you need RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation. With a RAG approach, the app first searches a knowledge base for relevant matches to a user's query, then sends the results to the LLM along with the original question. What if you have documents that should only be accessed by a subset of your users, like a group or a single user? Then you need data access controls to ensure that document visibility is respected during the RAG flow. In this session, we'll show an approach using Azure AI Search with data access controls to only search the documents that can be seen by the logged in user. We'll also demonstrate a feature for user-uploaded documents that uses data access controls along with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.",
