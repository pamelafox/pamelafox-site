## Local development


```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

```shell
pre-commit install
```

```shell
flask --debug --app src/app:app run --port 50505
```

Then open the website at localhost:5000.

## Deployment instructions

This project is designed for deployment on Azure Static Web Apps.

Steps for deployment:

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure Subscription.
2. Install the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). (If you open this repository in Codespaces or with the VS Code Dev Containers extension, that part will be done for you.)
3. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

4. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "django-app"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location (like "eastus"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for some of the resources.

5. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI to see the website.

6. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```

## CI/CD pipeline

This project includes a Github workflow for deploying the resources to Azure
on every push to main. That workflow requires several Azure-related authentication secrets
to be stored as Github action secrets. To set that up, run:

```shell
azd pipeline config
```
